While K-Means clustering is a popular method, it may not always be the best choice for clustering, especially when the data has complex structures. Here are some alternative clustering methods that you can consider:

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):

Pros: Can find arbitrarily shaped clusters and is robust to noise.
Cons: Requires careful tuning of parameters (epsilon and minimum samples).
Use Case: Suitable for datasets with noise and clusters of varying densities.
Hierarchical Clustering:

Pros: Does not require the number of clusters to be specified in advance and provides a dendrogram (tree-like diagram) which can be used to decide the number of clusters.
Cons: Computationally expensive for large datasets.
Use Case: Useful for smaller datasets where you want to understand the data hierarchy.
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM):

Pros: Can model clusters with different shapes and sizes (elliptical shapes).
Cons: Requires specifying the number of components and can be sensitive to initialization.
Use Case: Suitable for data that can be well-modeled by Gaussian distributions.
Spectral Clustering:

Pros: Effective for clusters with complex shapes and is based on graph theory.
Cons: Computationally expensive and requires specifying the number of clusters.
Use Case: Suitable for datasets where clusters are connected but not necessarily compact.
